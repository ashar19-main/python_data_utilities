Handling a large SOAP API response with a high level of nested objects efficiently requires a few optimizations. Given the scale you're dealing with (200,000 primary objects and up to 12 levels of nesting), the main concerns are memory management and processing speed.
Here are some improvements you can make:

1. Stream Processing: If possible, process the data in a streaming manner rather than loading everything into memory at once. This depends on whether the SOAP API and the zeep library support streaming.

2. Efficient Flattening Function: Optimize the flattening function to handle deep nesting more efficiently, perhaps using iterative techniques instead of recursive ones to avoid stack overflow and reduce overhead.

3. Batch Processing: Process the data in batches rather than all at once to reduce memory usage.

4. Parallel Processing: If the operation is CPU-bound, use parallel processing techniques to leverage multiple cores.

This code introduces parallel processing and batch processing. It's important to adjust the batch_size according to your system's memory capacity. The parallel processing is done using Python's concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor, which can significantly speed up the processing time on multi-core systems.Remember, the efficiency of this approach heavily depends on the specifics of your data and system capabilities. You may need to fine-tune the batch size or the number of threads in the thread pool for optimal performance. Also, if your SOAP API supports streaming, consider using that feature to handle large responses more efficiently.
